```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#import 1hsg pdb file
library(bio3d)
file.name <- get.pdb("1hsg")
hiv <- read.pdb(file.name)
```

```{r}
#get a quick summary of the pdb structure
hiv
```

Before proceeding with docking, we have to first extract just the protein atoms
```{r}
prot <- trim.pdb(hiv, "protein") #get protein portion
lig <- trim.pdb(hiv, "ligand") #get ligand portion

write.pdb(prot, file="1hsg_protein.pdb") #write protein portion into pdb file
write.pdb(lig, "1hsg_ligand.pdb") #write ligand portion into pdb file
```


## Use AutoDockTools to set up protein docking input
Docking algorithms require atoms to have charge and atom type info, which PDB structures don't have

We have to prep the protein and ligand files to include these info

Use AutoDock Tools (ADT) to do so
```{r}

```
